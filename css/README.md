## Piggyvest Calculator
This project aims at calculating user savings. **There are five saving options** with Piggyvest and one investment option.

There is a fixed interest percent on how much is invested using the savings app.

The interest is calculated based on the amount saved by customers.

The savings options are:
- Piggybank, 10% per annum.

- Flex naira, 10% per annum.


- Safelock varies based on number of days funds are locked for.

- Target, 10% per annum.
- Flex dollar, 5% per ann
um.
- Investify is 2% per month from five months upwards.
So, basically what our app does is to calculate the interests collected over the savings of customers.
We will integrate our calculator to give the interest on a daily basis too.
